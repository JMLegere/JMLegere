# Verifying Events

## The Problem:

The problem with review and verification is that often the event does not contain enough information for review to be possible. With a title and sanitized description, the event is sometimes a black box that users cannot independently verify. With verification of data being important to several potential users, this problem needs to be solved.

## The Solution:

One way of solving this problem, is to rework events to contain a model of the timeline that the event proposes. If we think, an event is essentially a report that certain entities performed certain actions at a certain time.

Given this, we can model events with an entity-relationship model, where the entities are:

1. Subjective Entities (Entities that can take actions)
	1. Organizations and Companies
	2. People
2. Objective Entities (Entities that cannot take actions)
	1. Accounts
	2. Wallets
3. Actions
	1. Promise of Goods
	2. Correspondence
	3. Transactions
4. Relationships
	1. Ownership
	2. A person belonging to an organization

Attaching evidence to these 4 things allows us to ask for independent verification of the event, since reviewers will be able to either ask for evidence, or verify that the model is true.

We can then prompt for evidence based on the event model the user creates.
