# Meeting Notes Today

## 830am

MEETING NOTES  

- Smartledger is being 'aggressive'
- If they become a big advocate, they will start trying to sell us to others which is not ideal
- Got a hold of sekuritance CEO last night and wants to chat today
- They want wallet level scam detection
- We need to write some Qs for Dhirendra to ask Sekuritance about their POC
- 'Risk Score API'
- **What about an endpoint where you send an address, and it just returns the set of labels on that address (and not a score)? We could also make a judgement [boolean] whether the tx should go through or not based on the label set**
- Dhirendra found graph explorer demo confusing
- Moved graph away immediately, why have it show up in the first place?
- Unclear relationship from a demo perspective between tiles and graph
