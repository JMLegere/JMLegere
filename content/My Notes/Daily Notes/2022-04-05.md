# De-Fi Monitoring - Suspicious Activity

For monitoring I’m assuming this means “for every new transaction/block that occurs on a blockchain, analyze the contents (monitor) and send me some kind of notification (email? notification on graywolf? text?)”

And for “suspicious activity” I’m assuming it means large scale analytics, similar to the prototype on the “DeFi Monitoring” section of the platform.

Examples of “suspicious activity” that is simple - not requiring large analytics: ”its suspicious if there is an amount in a transaction that is over this value” ”if this address performs more than X transactions in this block” ”if this address in a list of suspicious addresses that I have makes any activity at all”

Examples of suspicious activity that requires analytics: ”cyclical trading of ethereum based tokens to look out for wash trading” (the defi monitoring prototype on the graywolf platform now ”arbitrage attacks resulting in a net income of over $X”

I’m also assuming they would want to put in lists of addresses and or transactions and or any of the metadata associated with the activity, and also assuming they would want a way to turn on/off/pause alerts for specific things.

Building all of these things seems like a good move eventually, but if we knew what they were hoping for first that would be good
