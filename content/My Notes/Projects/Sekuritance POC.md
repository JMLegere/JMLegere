# Sekuritance & Gray Wolf POC

The aim of this document is to summarise the POC project being discussed between parties and the expected deliverables.

## **Wallet Risk Score Check API**

A simple JSON Restful API which returns a risk score (can be an overall risk score or a detailed breakdown of the score) given a wallet address. A sample CURL request would be the following or similar:

>[!CODE]
>curl --location --request POST 'https://graywolf.com/wallets/check' \  
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \  
--data-raw '{ "chain":"BSC", "address":"0xfd805364d6455ed6474964e3F5a7aFED2DB25312"  
}'

The response would be something similar to this (0 Low Risk, 1 High risk):

> [!CODE]
{  
 "riskScore":"0.25"  
}

It would be great if you can include the reason why a particular wallet was flagged as high risk, it is valuable information for us and our clients usually ask for it as well.

## Ongoing Monitoring API

To keep our databases up to date, it would be good to have an updated risk score (if thereâ€™s any) of all the wallet addresses we checked against your database. The API callback payload would be something similar to this:

>[!CODE]
>{  
 "chain":"BSC",  
 "address":"0xfd805364d6455ed6474964e3F5a7aFED2DB25312",  
 "riskScore": "0.45"  
}

## Security

We are open to implement any security/authentication mechanism you are currently using for your APIs, so please do let us know how you wish to proceed with this matter.
