# Competing Against Luck, by Clayton Christensen


- The fallacy of active vs passive data from jobs to be done
	- First companies usually kill the job, but evolve towards products and competition
	- Each business that has sustained success builds the business around the job to be done
	- The problem of letting your product define what market you are in
		- You are not in the business of selling drills, you are in the business of making holes.
	- Startups find a way to drill 1/4" holes, not 1/4" holes
- The fallacy of surface growth
	- Trying to do more and more jobs for the same customers will make you rub up against a competitor in that space that specializes in only that job
		- A newspaper that tries to help their customers unwind at the end of the day are suddenly competing against television
- The fallacy of conforming data
	- causes companies to lose their focus
	- Data has an annoying way of conforming itself to support any view we want it to
		- Statistics is the most biased math field
	- We can make a statistic conform to any way we want. Interpreting data is very subjective
