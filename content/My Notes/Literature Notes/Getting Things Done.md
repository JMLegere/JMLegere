# Getting Things Done

_**Getting Things Done**_ (**GTD**) is a personal productivity system developed by [David Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Allen_(author) "David Allen (author)") and published in a book of the same name. Allen states "there is an inverse relationship between things on your mind and those things getting done".

The GTD workflow consists of five stages. The workflow is driven by five questions (black rectangles in the diagram on the right): capture, clarify, organize, reflect, and engage. (The first edition used the names collect, process, organize, plan, and do; the descriptions of the stages are similar in both editions). Once all the material ("stuff") is captured (or collected) in the inbox, each item is clarified and organized by asking and answering questions about each item in turn as shown in the black boxes in the logic tree diagram. As a result, items end up in one of the eight oval end points in the diagram:

- in the trash
- on the someday/maybe list
- in a neat reference filing system
- on a list of tasks, with the outcome and next action defined if the "incomplete" is a "project" (i.e., if it will require two or more steps to complete it)
- immediately completed and checked off if it can be completed in under two minutes
- delegated to someone else and, if one wants a reminder to follow up, added to a "waiting for" list
- on a context-based "next action" list if there is only one step to complete it
- on one's calendar

Empty one's inbox or inboxes daily or at least weekly ("in" to empty). Do not use one's inbox as a "to do" list. Do not put clarified items back into the inbox. Emptying one's inbox does not mean finishing everything. It just means applying the "capture, clarify, organize" steps to all one's "stuff".

Next, reflection (termed planning in the first edition) occurs. Multi-step projects identified above are assigned a desired outcome and a single "next action". Finally, a task from one's [task list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#Implementation_of_goals "Time management") is worked on ("engage" in the 2nd edition, "do" in the 1st edition) unless the calendar dictates otherwise. One selects which task to work on next by considering where one is (i.e., the "context", such as at home, at work, out shopping, by the phone, at one's computer, with a particular person), time available, energy available, and priority.
