- Romantic suspicion of politeness by jean jaques rousseau
- Being frank and open with others was seen as a national virtue of the United States
	- Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn
- Frankness vs Politeness
	- Different way to view the world
		- Original Goodness vs Natural sin
			- Frank people assume what is honest can not be disgusting or cruel
			- Frankness' trust in basic purity assumes that things will be fine and erodes the rationale for editing or self-censorship  
			- Polite people believe in natural sin
				- Politeness is to proceed under a suspicion of your own impulses
				- To be polite is to believe what you think might be received as offensive or frightening to others.

- Frankness without politeness is the surest way of being considered rude. And politeness without frankness is deceitfulness and lack of authenticity.
- It is important to know that you can be both polite and frank.
- the Frank person has the inner belief that other people are quite like them - the Polite person believes people are mostly in a much different place than them
