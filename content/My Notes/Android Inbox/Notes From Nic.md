# Notes From Nic

Yeah! I would start by buying one of the pi 4 boards

https://www.pishop.ca/product-category/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-boards/current-pi-boards/

It's also a good idea to get one of the approved power supplies. I've tried using phone chargers before and it undervolted everything and it kept crashing.

You don't have to use pishop, they're just the ones I bought from in the past.

I set up a pihole for ad blocking. I also did the unbound section.

I also added a custom blocklist because some were still getting though. I can't remember which ones I used here but you can always whitelist stuff afterwards. I remember having to add one for amazon so Prime would work in the house

I set up transmission to download torrents remotely

And samba to access shared drives

Finally, pivpn to access all of it remotely. I went with the wireguard install.

If you run a firestick, I sideloaded Kodi (https://kodi.tv/) and added The Crew (https://www.wirelesshack.org/how-to-install-the-crew-kodi-addon.html), the samba share and Real-Debrid (https://real-debrid.com/) and now between torrents and streams, we watch anything we want for like 5$ a month. You can also get an IPTV subscription if you care about cable but they're a little more sketchy to use.

Happy to answer any questions if you get stuck. I'm not a wiz but I can try my best haha
