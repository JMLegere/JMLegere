# Large Scrum Teams Should Be Broken into Smaller Teams Focused on the Same Product.

#agile #claim

[[Every internal team should be small enough that it can be fed with two pizzas]].

These cohesive scrum teams should share the same product goal, work off the same product backlog and share a product owner. The reason for this is that smaller teams are generally more focused and productive, and the overhead of scrum ceremonies like standup, planning is exponentially related to the size of the scrum team.
