**Psychological safety** is being able to show and employ one's self without fear of negative consequences of self-image, status or career (Kahn 1990, p.Â 708).(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety#cite_note-1) It can be defined as a shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety#cite_note-Edmondson-2) In _psychologically safe_ teams, team members feel accepted and respected. It is also the most studied enabling condition in [group dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_dynamics "Group dynamics") and [team learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_learning "Team learning") research
