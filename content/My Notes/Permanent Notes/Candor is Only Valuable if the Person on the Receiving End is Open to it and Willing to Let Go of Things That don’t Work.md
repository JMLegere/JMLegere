# Candor is Only Valuable if the Person on the Receiving End is Open to it and Willing to Let Go of Things That don’t Work.

It is important to prepare everyone that 'candor is expected' and to prepare to hear other people's truths. Unexpected candor can be interpreted as a lack of tact, or offensive.

The title insinuates that candor can sometimes cause harm. I believe this to be true. Setting expectations around norms in the workplace is important before removing your filter and talking frankly. People need to feel safe, [[Psychological Safety, after Kahn]].
