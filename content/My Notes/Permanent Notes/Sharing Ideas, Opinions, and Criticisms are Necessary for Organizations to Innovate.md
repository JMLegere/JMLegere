	- [ ] Creative roles follow the '10x' principle
		- [ ] Knowledge work vs Routine Work
		- [ ] creative knowledge workers
			- [ ] [Passion for one's job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_satisfaction) is key to high performance
			- [ ] anticipatory imagination
			- [ ] problem seeking
			- [ ] generating ideas
