# Within a Scrum Team, There Are No Sub-teams or Hierarchies.

When using an agile methodology in a team, **hierarchy should no longer exist**. Scrum aims for this flat organization structure, as every member is equally important. Thus roles like the SCRUM master or product owner are part of the team, and on the same horizontal level with the developers. The roles are not about authority, but more about the scope and mindset. 

## Agile organizations are relatively flat when compared to traditional organizations.
