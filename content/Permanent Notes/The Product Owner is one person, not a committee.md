# The Product Owner is One Person, Not a Committee.

The product owner being one person allows for someone to be accountable for the ordering of work in the backlog. For the same reason that [[We Should Only Show Work That is Ready to the Development Team]], we should not burden people unnecessarily with work that can be done with one person.

If there is no ownership of the tasks that the product owner is responsible for, then there is nobody making sure that those things will get done and nobody accountable if these things are not getting done properly.
